.SH NAME
ldms-static-test.sh \- Run a canned test scenario

.SH SYNOPSIS
ldms-static-test.sh [-l]
ldms-static-test.sh <input_file> [test_dir]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The ldms-static-test.sh command starts a canned test defined in the input_file
using a standard environment. The input file is written in a simple bash macro
language described in LANGUAGE below. Supporting configuration file fragments
will be used, as determined from the input file. See FILES below.
This tests ldmsd run with static configuration files (as would normally
happen as a system service) and shut down with a signal.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-l
.br
List the canned tests available.

.SH LANGUAGE

The following macro language is provided as extensions on bash.
Other bash use is also possible, but not recommended.

.TP
LDMSD <daemon-numbers>
.br
This starts a number of daemons described by daemon-numbers. The numbers can
be a given list, such as "1 2 3". The environment of each daemon (and its config script)
will contain the variable i set to one of the given values, as described in
ENVIRONMENT. For each value of i, a configuration fragment $input_file.$i must also exist. Use seq(1) to generate large number sequences.
.TP
MESSAGE [arguments]
.br
The expanded arguments are logged.
.TP
LDMS_LS <k> [ldms_ls_args]
.br
This invokes ldms_ls on the k-th ldmsd.
.TP
KILL_LDMSD <daemon-numbers>
.br
Kills the listed daemons.
.TP
SLEEP <n>
.br
Sleeps n seconds and logs a message about it.
.TP
JOBDATA jobfile [daemon-numbers]
.br
Creates jobfile with data for the jobid plugin to parse.
If daemon numbers are specified, creates a jobfile.$k for each
value of k listed in daemon-numbers. Each file will have
unique numeric values, sequentially increasing.
This does not provide data in the slurm-plugin sampler binary format.
.TP
vgon
.br
Turns on use of valgrind for any ldmsd or ldms_ls subsequently started.
.TP
vgoff
.br
Turns off use of valgrind for any ldmsd or ldms_ls subsequently started.
.TP
file_created <filename>
.br
Verifies the existence and readability of filename.
.TP
bypass=<0,1>
.br
This variable assignment disables (1) or enables (0) all the macros described
above. Typical use is to skip one or more operations while debugging a
test script.
.TP
portbase=<K>
.br
The listening port numbers assigned to the daemons will be K+i, where i is as described for
macro LDMSD. It is a good idea (to support automated testing) if portbase is set
in <input_file> so that each test uses a unique range of ports. This enables tests
to proceed in parallel.


.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following variables are visible to the input file and the configuration file.
.TP
i
.br
Daemon configuration files and commands can refer to ${i} where i is the
integer daemon number supplied via LDMSD for the specific
daemon using the script.
.TP
portN
.br
Daemon configuration files and commands can refer to ${portN} where N is any
value of 'i' described above. portN is the data port number of the N-th daemon.
.TP
input
.br
The name of the input file as specified when invoking this command.
.TP
testname
.br
The base name (directories stripped) of the input file name.
This variable makes it possible to use similar input across many test
files when the name of the input file is the same as the plugin tested.
.TP
TESTDIR
.br
Root directory of the testing setup.
.TP
STOREDIR
.br
A directory that should be used for store output configuration.
.TP
LOGDIR
.br
A directory that should be used for log outputs.
.TP
LDMS_AUTH_FILE
.br
Secret file used for daemon communication.
.TP
XPRT
.br
The transport used. It may be specified in the environment to override
the default 'sock', and it is exported to the executed daemon environment.

.SH NOTES
Any other variable may be defined and exported for use in the attribute/value
expansion of values in plugin configuration.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I $input_file.$i
.br
For each value of i specifed to start an ldmsd, a configuration file named
$input_file.$i must also exist. This configuration file is used when starting the daemon.
.TP
.I [test_dir]
.br
If test_dir is supplied, it is used as the test output directory.
The default output location is `pwd`/ldmstest/$testname.
.TP
.I $docdir/examples/static-test/$input_file
.br
If input_file is not found in the current directory, it is checked for in $docdir/examples/static-test/$input_file.
