Man page for the LDMS slingshot_metrics plugin

:Manual group: LDMS sampler


SYNOPSIS
========

| Within ldmsd_controller or a configuration file:
| config name=slingshot_metrics [ <attr> = <value> ]

DESCRIPTION
===========

With LDMS (Lightweight Distributed Metric Service), plugins for the
ldmsd (ldms aemon) are configured via ldmsd_controller or a
configuration file. The slingshot_metrics plugin provides a single
metric set that contains a list of records. Each record contains all of
the metrics for a single slingshot NIC.

The slingshot_metrics sampler plugin provides detailed counter metrics
for each slignshot NIC.

The schema is named "slingshot_metrics" by default.

CONFIGURATION ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX
==============================

The slingshot_metrics plugin uses the sampler_base base class. This man
page covers only the configuration attributes, or those with default
values, specific to the this plugin; see :ref:`ldms_sampler_base(7) <ldms_sampler_base>` for the
attributes of the base class.

**config**
   | name=<plugin_name> [counters=<COUNTER NAMES>] [counters_file=<path
     to counters file>]
   | configuration line

   name=<plugin_name>
      |
      | This MUST be slingshot_metrics.

   counters=<COUNTER NAMES>
      |
      | (Optional) A CSV list of names of slingshot counter names. See
        Section COUTNER NAMES for details. If neither this option nor
        counters_file are specified, a default set of counters will be
        used.

   counters_files=<path to counters file>
      |
      | (Optional) A path to a file that contains a list of counter
        names, one per line. See Section COUNTER NAMES for details. A
        line will be consider a comment if the character on the line is
        a "#". If neither this option nor counters are specified, a
        default set of counters will be used.

   refresh_interval_sec=<seconds>
      |
      | (Optional) The sampler caches the list of slinghost devices, and
        that cache is refreshed at the beginning of a sample cycle if
        the refresh interval time has been exceeded.
        refresh_interval_sec sets the minimum number of seconds between
        refreshes of the device cache. The default refresh interval is
        600 seconds.

COUNTER NAMES
=============

The names of the counters can be found in the slingshot/cassini header
file cassini_cntr_def.h in the array c1_cntr_defs (specifically the
strings in the "name" field of said array entries).

NOTE: If you used "group:<group name>" syntax in the past, that is no longer
available due to API changes in the Slingshot Host Software stack (at least
as of release/shs-12.0.0, perhaps earlier).

However, you one may still use "group:all" to include all available counters.

EXAMPLES
========

Within ldmsd_conteroller or a configuration file:

::

   load name=slingshot_metrics
   config name=slingshot_metrics producer=host1 instance=host1/slingshot_metrics counters=ixe_rx_tcp_pkt,group:hni refresh_interval_sec=3600
   start name=slingshot_metrics interval=1000000 offset=0
