.SH NAME
Plugin_lustre_ost - man page for the LDMS lustre_ost plugin

.SH SYNOPSIS
Within ldmsd_controller or a configuration file:
.br
config name=lustre_ost

.SH DESCRIPTION
With LDMS (Lightweight Distributed Metric Service), plugins for the ldmsd (ldms daemon) are configured via ldmsd_controller
or a configuration file.

The lustre_ost plugin provides metric sets for two different schemas: lustre_ost and lustre_ost_job_stats.

The metric sets using schema lustre_ost will have a producer name set to the hostname,
and the instance name set to the ost name.  The data for these metrics sets come from a combination
of the data in /proc/fs/lustre/ost/*/stats and a few other single-value files in /proc/fs/lustre/ost/*/.

The metric sets using schema lustre_ost_job_stats will have a producer name set to the hostname,  and the
instance name will be set to a combination of the ost name and the job_id string.  The data for these metrics sets
come from /proc/fs/lustre/ost/*/job_stats.

This plugin currently employs zero configuration. Any user-supplied configuration values will be ignored.  Future versions may add
configuration options.

This plugin should work with at least Lustre versions 2.8, 2.10,
2.12 and 2.15. The debugfs filesystem must be mounted for lustre
data access, which is also usually restricted to the root user.
