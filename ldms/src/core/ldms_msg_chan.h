/**
 * A Message Channel is a reliable connected interface between one or
 * more peers. A Message Channel differs from a Message Client in the
 * following way:
 *
 * - A Message Channel will attempt to connect and reconnect
 *   automatically with a peer.
 *
 * - Messages published ot a channel are queued until the connection
 *   is established up until a configurable buffer limit is
 *   reached. The default is 1MB.
 *
 * - A message Channel can be instantiated in one of three modes:
 *
 *   - PUBLISH    A connection is established with a remote peer and
 *                messages can be published with ldms_msg_chan_publish()
 *
 *   - SUBSCRIBE The message channel will listen for incoming
 *               connections. Channels can be subscribed to with
 *               ldms_msg_chan_subscribe().
 *
 *   - BIDIR     The channel is bi-directional and can both publish and
 *               subscribe.
