#!/bin/sh
# This is a script for developers with repo access to generate rpm from
# bare checkouts.
# It replaces (i.e. violates, of necessity) the normal split-responsibility
# model of
# 1) project release ready to use source tar ball where ./configure is working.
# 2) independent product packager/distribution manager/vendor adds in spec
#     file wisdom/value.
# This leads to some Rube Goldbergism, as should be expected.
#
# It is specific to the way we run on certain DOE machines.
# You are free to copy it to other names and tune it to your systems.
# You may also need to make your own (differently named)
#    ./util/release_tarball-300-rhine.sh
# replacement, in particular if you want to pull a specific repository branch.
# Please note:
# Configuration options later in this script affect the source tar ball generated by make dist, so you cannot optimize away the double invocation of configure.
#
# Correct checkout tests:
